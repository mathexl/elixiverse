      <p className="p5">
        Mira&rsquo;s earliest memory, when her body was just a lump atop two
        sprigs, when Mr. Zouch treated her as a girl and not a nuisance, was of
        Friar Sorin. She was four, or maybe five, and the old man was telling
        her about Daisha, an underwater city, a fairy tale.
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;How do people breathe there?&rdquo; asked Mira, her tightened
        fists like small kiwis in both shade and size.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Elixirs. Magical elixirs.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Everything the friar described sounded so perfect, like the world was
        forged by his imagination alone.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t <em>we</em> have elixirs?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t under the seas now, are we, Mira?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t they keep us safe?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Oh love, we already are safe,&rdquo; promised Friar Sorin, his
        grin revealing his yellow teeth that rested underneath his wiry excuse
        of a mustache. &ldquo;The Consort&rsquo;s sortixes don&rsquo;t even know
        that a house like this exists. I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        The Consort. An ever-present name in Mira&rsquo;s mind without a face or
        figure to attach it too. She&rsquo;d heard tales of the Consort
        throughout her youth, and not just from the lips of Friar Sorin.
        Everyone, even the friar, was frightened by the woman&rsquo;s existence.
        They spoke of her like she was a ghost, as if she could hide under
        someone&rsquo;s bed and feast on their brains before sunrise. When her
        name was mentioned, even casually, it became like an infection&mdash;the
        topic of the tyrant and her sortixes wouldn&rsquo;t cease until sundown
        forced the gossip&rsquo;s end.{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira gazed through the window in the friar&rsquo;s study, staring at the
        eldertrees stretching into the air at the wood&rsquo;s edge. &ldquo;Why
        is the Consort so mean, Friar?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the friar softly. &ldquo;But
        you mustn&rsquo;t worry about her, young one. She&rsquo;s quite far away
        from you.&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;How far?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Far-far.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        That made Mira smile, not because of his promise but the way the old man
        said it. He spoke with gentle swishes of his head, his trimmed beard
        bobbing like a boat on a quiet day.{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira glanced at the ground. &ldquo;Is the Consort meaner than
        Dova?&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Her dumb sister had ripped off her doll&rsquo;s left leg in the morning.
        The beloved thing was now an amputee.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        The friar chuckled and touched her shoulder. &ldquo;Be nice to her,
        Mira. She&rsquo;s younger, yes, but Dova will grow to like you over the
        years. That&rsquo;s what sisters do. I promise.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;No way. She&rsquo;s so <em>infuri-</em>ting.&rdquo; Mira had just
        learnt that word from Mr. Zouch, the chateau&rsquo;s very own conspiracy
        theorist. &ldquo;She ate my morning cookie, too.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her way of saying that she wants your
        attention.&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira tightly shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her
        attention.&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;No. What you want&rdquo;&mdash;the friar bopped her
        nose&mdash;&ldquo;is a friend.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p4">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p7">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p8">‚ÅÇ</p>
      <p className="p7">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p5">
        As always, Friar Sorin was correct. As they got older, Mira and
        Dova&rsquo;s laughter alone would spook the kisras whenever the duo
        hopped about the harka.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Today was one of those carefree days.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I caught seven! New record.&rdquo; Dova squished the captured
        bugs in her little hands, crinkling their wings.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira grunted. &ldquo;Be careful. They might bite if you hold them too
        tight.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just saying that &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m
        winning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Suddenly, Mira leapt and caught a blue-winged kisra with just two
        fingers. She beamed at the insect. According to Mr. Zouch, blue ones
        were extraordinarily rare.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;This one counts as five!&rdquo; Mira piped.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;No fair. Since when was that a rule?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m older. I <em>make</em> the rules.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira was two years older. Somehow, Dova was two inches taller.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Dova held a squirming bug awfully close to her left eye. &ldquo;Mira,
        what if we &hellip; <em>ate</em> the kisras!&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Yuck! Who told you that was a good idea?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Dova spun in circles with her arms
        thrown out. &ldquo;Mr. Zouch said something about protein.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira snorted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like Mr. Zouch. He&rsquo;s{" "}
        <em>crazy</em>.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        The duo flopped around the field for a few more minutes in a desperate
        attempt to up their count. The meadow was covered by the harka grass.
        Sometimes, the adults would get lazy and not trim the lawn for moons.
        The leaves would yellow and grow as tall as cornstalks. Today, the harka
        teased Mira&rsquo;s kneecaps. The perfect height for kisra snatching.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Suddenly, Dova froze and glared at the Fifty-Year Forest, a woods filled
        with spindly eldertrees that stretched around the front-yard like a
        ginormous horseshoe. Mira shuddered whenever she stared into it, fearful
        of the prickly, poisonous trees and the awful creatures that they
        harbored.
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Why&rsquo;re you looking at the woods, Dova?&rdquo; asked Mira
        quietly.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        A smile stole Dova&rsquo;s lips&mdash;a mischievous smile. &ldquo;What
        if we look for kisras in there?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;NO!&rdquo; hissed Mira, the veto spoken like a sneeze.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dangerous, Dova. Friar Sorin says beasties live in
        the woods.&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Dova giggled. &ldquo;<em>Beasties</em>. Such a funny word.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira grimaced. &ldquo;No, it is not funny. Remember, our daddy died
        &lsquo;cause a beastie.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Dova spun around. &ldquo;No, he did not. A scorpion bit him.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;A Blueneck scorpion <em>is</em> a beastie, dumb-dumb. It&rsquo;s
        just a little one.&rdquo;{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Fine. No forest kisras,&rdquo; said Dova with a pout. Then, that
        smile returned. &ldquo;Wait, I know! What if we spy on Mr. Zouch
        tonight?&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira shook her head. &ldquo;Stop being silly, Dova. He&rsquo;ll just
        report us again. Friar Sorin got mad last time.&rdquo; Then Mira
        scrunched her nose. &ldquo;Besides, don&rsquo;t you have that Maritan
        thing to prepare for?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;<em>Maripan</em>,&rdquo; corrected Dova, placing her hands on her
        hips, squishing her kisras. &ldquo;Aunty says don&rsquo;t mispronounce
        Noln words, or we&rsquo;ll forget our culture.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Aunty Tarin use a head towel as her <em>heja</em>
        ?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        That made Dova cackle. Hejas were headscarves that Noln men and women
        wore when they got older. Aunty Tarin often used a bath towel as a
        substitute, sometimes for the entire day.
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re doing Maripan this year,&rdquo;
        said Dova. &ldquo;Not anymore.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        For as long as she could remember, Dova and Aunty Tarin celebrated
        Maripan every year after fasting for a moon. Mira didn&rsquo;t.
        She&rsquo;d been christened a Celestine after her father. Her{" "}
        <em>late</em> father. She couldn&rsquo;t remember him. Nor her mother.
        Her mother died giving birth to Dova. Her father died a year later from
        that Blueneck scorpion bite. Cranky Aunty Tarin was the only family the
        girls had left.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira stored her caught kisras in little pockets that she&rsquo;d sewn
        around her dress&rsquo;s waist. Last week, she&rsquo;d added flaps and
        buttons to cage the critters from escaping. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;re you
        skipping Maripan this year?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Dova threw up her shoulders and puckered her lips. &ldquo;Dunno.
        Something &lsquo;bout rumors.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Rumors?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Yeah, rumors. Aunty is worried &lsquo;bout something.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Suddenly, Mira dove and plucked another kisra fluttering through the
        air. She crashed with the ground and smiled after examining its belly.
        Another blue one&mdash;that made two rare catches on the same day!{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Ha! I&rsquo;m winning!&rdquo; Mira exclaimed, picking herself
        back up and proudly displaying the prisoner by its hind leg.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Dova frowned. &ldquo;No fair, you were distracting me.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">&ldquo;No, you were distracting yourself.&rdquo;</p>
      <p className="p6">
        The two sisters continued their romp through the harka grass, two
        predators laughing whilst diving for the itty critters that burrowed
        themselves in the dirt to protect themselves from the girls&rsquo;
        sticky fingers.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Girls, come in. The chef made supper.&rdquo; Friar Sorin was
        stumbling towards them, wearing heavy slacks and padded mittens to
        protect himself from the itchy rashes. The harka was harmless to
        children but poisonous to adults, especially oldies like the friar.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;But Friar! I don&rsquo;t want to go in.&rdquo; Dova launched
        herself backwards onto the yellowed grass, releasing over a dozen bugs
        into the air. &ldquo;This is my favorite place in the whole wide
        world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Dova, that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; said Mira,
        pocketing her final catch. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been nowhere else.&rdquo;{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I just know.&rdquo; Dova looked petulantly at the old man.
        &ldquo;Friar, can&rsquo;t we play for thirty more minutes?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Friar Sorin shook his head, his crinkly beard swishing through the air.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late, Dova. Come have supper. Remember, if you
        don&rsquo;t eat now, you won&rsquo;t have room for pani bread after
        Maripan prayers.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Dova&rsquo;s not doing Maripan this year,&rdquo; muttered Mira.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Friar Sorin bent his knees to crouch to Dova&rsquo;s sightline.
        &ldquo;Really? Is that so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Dova nodded. &ldquo;Aunty said it&rsquo;s dangerous this year.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;No, no. We mustn&rsquo;t give up our traditions, Dova. It is what
        connects us to our true selves.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I know, I know. It wasn&rsquo;t my idea, Friar! I like the Pani
        bread. But Aunty&rsquo;s scared.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Friar Sorin tilted his head at the looming chateau that stretched into
        the dry airs. &ldquo;How about we go inside and have supper, and
        I&rsquo;ll talk to your aunty about doing Maripan this year. Your aunty
        is being silly. There is nothing to fear.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p4">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p9">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p8">‚ÅÇ</p>
      <p className="p7">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p5">
        &ldquo;Dova, stop coughing,&rdquo; hissed Mira. &ldquo;Nobody can know
        that we were in here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        A few afternoons later, the two of them were creeping around Mr. Leopold
        Zouch&rsquo;s bedroom that doubled as his study. He had the biggest room
        in the chateau yet the least walking space&mdash;the suite was cluttered
        with papers, maps, figurines, and whatnot.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Are you sure he&rsquo;s on a walk?&rdquo; whispered Dova.
        &ldquo;Does Mr. Zouch even go on walks?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;As of recently. Something &lsquo;bout it exercising away the
        Consortium&rsquo;s stench.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Stench?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Apparently it&rsquo;s how the Consortium tracks him.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">&ldquo;That sounds like rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Zouch. It&rsquo;s always rubbish.&rdquo;{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Dova scratched her scalp. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he smart before?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira nodded. &ldquo;The chef said he used to be the best metallurgist in
        all of Rothersby.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;So what happened? Did he drop some metal on his head?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira shrugged. &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Finally, she found what she&rsquo;d been seeking: Mr. Zouch&rsquo;s
        diary. The little book was already open. She glanced at the first
        paragraph that detailed kisras being the root cause of brain funguses.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">Mira held out her palm. &ldquo;Dova, give it.&rdquo;</p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the magic word?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Dova, <em>please</em> give it.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the magic word.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Then?&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Dova smirked. &ldquo;Remember my new name?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira&rsquo;s eyes kept spinning like a bicycle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not
        a word. That&rsquo;s a name.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Names are words.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have time for this. Mr. Zouch&rsquo;ll catch
        us.&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Mira.&rdquo; Dova looked like she might burst into
        tears. She was good at that. &ldquo;You promised!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Fine. <em>Princess Dova of Daisha</em>, give me the hair.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Yesterday, Dova won the kisra competition by over a dozen, and as
        punishment, Mira had to address her as such.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Very well, my royal <em>servant</em>,&rdquo; replied Dova smugly.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Then Dova produced the lock of hair. Earlier, they couldn&rsquo;t figure
        out how to snatch the chef&rsquo;s without him noticing, so Mira had
        trimmed off a lock of her own.
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mira. She scattered a few hairs throughout
        the book. &ldquo;Mr. Zouch is gonna&rsquo; throw a riot at the
        chef.&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Are you sure we got the color right? This looks like Friar
        Sorin&rsquo;s, not the chef&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira&rsquo;s hair was straight and black whilst the chef&rsquo;s was
        blond and curly, so they&rsquo;d dipped Mira&rsquo;s in chef&rsquo;s
        bleach and tangled it up afterwards. Then they squirted some mustard on
        it to give it a golden sheen, but the pigment had faded, leaving a
        whitish mess.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s close enough,&rdquo; said Mira determinedly.
        &ldquo;Mr. Zouch knows Friar Sorin wouldn&rsquo;t sneak around his room.
        Only someone like the chef would.&rdquo;{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Or us,&rdquo; offered Dova.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">&ldquo;Good thing our hair is black.&rdquo;</p>
      <p className="p6">
        The two of them slyly ventured out, backs hunched and arms made like
        seagull wings.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Shortly after exiting, Dova leaned into Mira&rsquo;s ear and whispered,
        &ldquo;I want to go to Daisha.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira huffed. &ldquo;How many times, Dova? Daisha isn&rsquo;t{" "}
        <em>real</em>.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Friar makes it sound real.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Friar can make anything sound real. He&rsquo;s the friar.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p4">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p10">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p8">‚ÅÇ</p>
      <p className="p10">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p5">
        Mira and Dova were playing tic-tac-toe&mdash;or as the Friar would call
        it, crosses-and-naughts&mdash;in the living room. Mira wished
        she&rsquo;d put a wager on this game. Dova was hilariously bad at it.
        Mira could&rsquo;ve easily been Duchess of Daisha.
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;POZI. POZI PUDDLESTEM, WHERE ARE YOU?&rdquo; boomed the voice of
        Mr. Zouch. The man stomped into the living room like an ogre, his cheeks
        red like spanked bottoms, his lips blue from whatever grotesque pumpkin
        he&rsquo;d been munching on.{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;W-w-what&rsquo;s wrong, Mr. Zouch,&rdquo; feigned Mira, praying
        that he wouldn&rsquo;t notice Dova&rsquo;s stashed smile.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;The darn boy&rsquo;s been looking through my diary!&rdquo; Mr.
        Zouch produced the book and shook it violently in the air. A shower of
        white specks fell from it. &ldquo;His hair is everywhere.&rdquo;{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Dova&rsquo;s giggle was fortunately concealed by a loud squeak of the
        door opening. The chef entered, palms sweaty, his scrawny figure
        trembling. <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;S-s-sir, you called?&rdquo; the chef stammered.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Pozipoo, how DARE you read my private diary.&rdquo; Mr. Zouch
        hurled the book at his head, missing miserably. &ldquo;These are private
        thoughts.&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo; hissed the chef, eyebrows up. &ldquo;I did no such
        thing.&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Then Dova&rsquo;s muffled snicker caught the chef&rsquo;s attention.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Did you two do it?&rdquo; said the chef, his hands squarely on
        his hips. <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; denied Mira flatly.</p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; echoed Dova.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mr. Zouch stared daggers at the chef. &ldquo;My diary is full of trade
        secrets. You have some nerve looking through them.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Trade secrets?&rdquo; The chef scowled. &ldquo;Oh please, Zouch.
        You&rsquo;re not even a metallurgist anymore.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mr. Zouch shook his head. &ldquo;Pozi, you should know better.
        You&apos;re an adult, boy. Behave like one.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m an adult, why&rsquo;re you calling me boy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re trying to be smart with me now? I should beat
        you for this.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it, Mr. Zouch. I swear.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Your hair is on every other page. It&rsquo;s like you took a
        haircut in my study.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Pozi
        squinted at the strands that Mr. Zouch held up. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not
        mine! That hair&rsquo;s too white to be mine. It looks like the
        friar&rsquo;s, honestly.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Told you,&rdquo; said Dova much too loudly, covering her mouth
        right after, but not tight enough for her subsequent &ldquo;oops&rdquo;
        to be silenced.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Now the chef and Mr. Zouch glared at the two girls, obviously sharing a
        joint verdict.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira smacked her own face. Dova was such a donut sometimes.{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p10">
        <br />

      <p className="p10">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p5">
        &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Dova&rsquo;s idea. It was mine,&rdquo; protested
        Mira.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mr. Zouch wasn&rsquo;t permitting her to see Dova. Not just
        him&mdash;Aunty Tarin, the chef, and even Friar Sorin insisted that Dova
        was to remain in her room. Alone. No debate.{" "}
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Dova&rsquo;s not being punished,&rdquo; said Mr. Zouch.
        &ldquo;This is a precaution.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;A precaution for what?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go outside and catch those bloody bugs, girl?
        Stop worrying.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira frowned. &ldquo;Why should I be worried?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Just go outside,&rdquo; growled Mr. Zouch. &ldquo;Cut me a
        pumpkin while you&rsquo;re at it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira sulked and slammed the door behind her. She wasn&rsquo;t going
        kisra hunting without Dova. That wasn&rsquo;t fair. She was going to
        bother the chef instead.
      </p>
      <p className="p4">
        <br />
      </p>
      <p className="p10">

      </p>
      <p className="p5">&ldquo;Mira, wake up.&rdquo;</p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira rubbed her eyes and groaned. The sun&rsquo;s rays were barely
        peeking above the forest&rsquo;s canopy.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        At the door stood Friar Sorin. Weird. He was never up this early. His
        usual loopy smile had dimmed. He blinked like he had an eye infection.
        Something was wrong.{" "}
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;You need to say goodbye.&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira fought her yawn. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        She considered that Mr. Zouch might be departing for Thiem, but his trip
        was supposed to be next moon, not today. Say goodbye to who? Mira
        remained in bed and sleepily stared back.
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        A smile crossed the friar&rsquo;s face unnaturally quickly. He crouched
        down, took her hand, and rubbed it gently.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;Come. It&rsquo;ll be okay. The Celestine One will lead the
        way.&rdquo;<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira ambled behind the friar&rsquo;s legs. As they approached
        Dova&rsquo;s room, she managed to frown. Mira hadn&rsquo;t been allowed
        to see her sister for the last four days. Why was she allowed to see her
        now? This early in the day?
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Inside, Aunty Tarin sobbed and rocked. Mira&rsquo;d never seen the women
        cry. She clutched Dova, who rested fast asleep on her shoulder. The
        chateau&rsquo;s residents packed the room with their gazes downcast. The
        chef. Mrs. Podima. Even Mr. Zouch.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mira,&rdquo; whispered the chef, rubbing her
        shoulder. <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo;</p>
      <p className="p6">
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry,&rdquo; he repeated, his eyes downcast.
        <span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Mira observed Aunty Tarin. The lady&rsquo;s hair was a cobweb, some
        locks wet from the tears streaming down her face. She was shaking
        Dova&rsquo;s frame roughly, yet somehow, the girl remained asleep.
        Something seemed off about Dova too. Her cheeks were tightened. Her
        fingers &hellip; they appeared slightly pale.
      </p>
      <p className="p6">
        Finally, Mira understood what had happened. She fought the compulsion to
        pass out.<span className="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
