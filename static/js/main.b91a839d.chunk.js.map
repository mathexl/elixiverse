Pregasen</h2>\n    <p>\n      Apricot Minolta was not a criminal. A thief, yes. Swindler would also be fair. \n      Hell, someone could call him a purloiner, and he would take offense\n      to the haughtiness over the accusation. But criminals were those that got\n      caught, and Apricot was anything but.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Same couldn&rsquo;t be said about his partner, though. Jox Li was not just\n      a criminal, but a proper one. She&rsquo;d been arrested by the numbing\n      scarves more times than Apricot&rsquo;d eaten his namesake, &agrave; la\n      aplenty. Daisha enforcers knew Jox&rsquo;s face like she was their god.\n      Maybe she was.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Make no mistake, Apricot and Jox weren&rsquo;t that<em>&nbsp;</em>\n      different. Both attended Chancellor Quail&rsquo;s conservatory as wee\n      children. In fact, they first met in Preceptor Dako&rsquo;s introductory\n      course. Terrible teacher. Marvelous peers. Oh, those were the good\n      times&mdash;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Maisor Misha has the stupidest designs of the big three</em>\n      ,&rdquo; sounded Jox&rsquo;s voice.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot suppressed a grin. &ldquo;<em>Absolutely</em>,&rdquo; he\n      transmitted back.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Sorry, similarities. There were many beyond their schooling. Both hated\n      high fashion with passion, but devilishly adored the associated riches.\n      Today was the perfect example of that. If this operation proved\n      successful, they&rsquo;d pilfer enough durling to buy apartments in\n      Eliza&rsquo;s district whilst gifting Maisor Misha a scandal. An\n      unbeatable win-win.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m outside the vault</em>,&rdquo; sounded Jox.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Alright. I&rsquo;m walking indoors</em>.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Right, the biggest commonality. Apricot and Jox were sriin symbiotes. They\n      micro-dosed on the elixir to foster an unbroken mental connection. Most\n      academics believed that such a feat was impossible, Dako included. But not\n      Apricot. He was as much a realist as Jox was a coward. Together,\n      they&rsquo;d experimented with Sriin for moons and discovered symbiotism,\n      word pending.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Hello. Can I help you?&rdquo; greeted the store clerk.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She was a beauty, no question about it. Flaxen hair. Neat eyes. A mousey\n      nose. Apricot could&rsquo;ve fallen for her if he stalled long enough.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Just browsing,&rdquo; said Apricot with a tip of his hat.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m inside the shop</em>,&rdquo; he transmitted soon\n      after.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>The clerk looks dashing enough for you, today</em>?&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot never lied to Jox, be it out of habit or necessity. Sriin only\n      transmitted true statements, period. Even casual remarks had to be\n      packaged formally. He&rsquo;d gotten used to ignoring the phrases that\n      cluttered his correspondence. &ldquo;My answer would be&rdquo;, &ldquo;I\n      want to ask you&rdquo;, etc. got annoying real quick. But, alas, they were\n      a practice required by their trade. By their connection.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>I await your confirmation</em>,&rdquo; she sounded.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Shut up</em>,&rdquo; he replied. Of course, that was &ldquo;I\n      want to tell Jox to &lsquo;Shut up&rsquo;.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>How many employees outside of the girl?</em>&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot examined the shop&rsquo;s interior. The flagship Maisor Misha\n      location wasn&rsquo;t here, but in Helsea Market along with its\n      competitors, Nayanthara and Han Pori Jai. Today, he was in a satellite\n      branch perched up in Gants Brae. Smaller collection, but this was where\n      the money was.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Two</em>.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Good</em>.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A casual shopper would consider Gants Brae to be a single story building.\n      It wasn&rsquo;t. Deep under was a vault of Maisor Misha&rsquo;s cash\n      reserves. Given sales from their hit Spring-Summer collection, there was\n      at least one thousand stacks\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>of durling\n      downstairs. Enough to buy twenty apartments in Eliza&rsquo;s district.\n      Twenty.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>The vault uses one manual lock and two argentate locks</em>\n      ,&rdquo; sounded Jox.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      They had prepared for this. The manual lock was easy &mdash; Jox was the\n      best lock-pick in Daisha. The woman had been arrested four times, but\n      never sentenced. Because of good defense barristers? Nope. Rather,\n      she&rsquo;d never faced a magistrate because no jail could hold her longer\n      than a week. Now, her capture came with a ten thousand durling reward,\n      plus ten percent of any thievery if she&rsquo;d been caught in the act.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But the argentate locks? Their mechanism was complicated. Inside the door\n      was a set of silver discs that had to perfectly oriented using the correct\n      elixir, Argent. Without the elixir, the lock was impenetrable, even to\n      Jox. With the elixir? Solvable, but tricky nevertheless.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>First is a three disc. Second is an eighteen disc</em>,&rdquo;\n      sounded Jox.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>On it. You&rsquo;re good for the first</em>?&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Obviously</em>.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Each disc had seven possible placements. With three hundred odd\n      permutations, the first lock was tedious but crackable via the old\n      guessing game. Jox would break it in five minutes, ten at the latest. But\n      the eighteener? That was on Apricot to figure out. He had to determine the\n      code whilst ensuring no employee went peeking downstairs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Apricot beckoned to the darling clerk. &ldquo;But\n      what colorways does this come in?&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He was pointing to a blue monogrammed scarf &mdash; in his book, the only\n      fashionable piece by the brand. The clerk produced a cute smile and ambled\n      over.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Elderleaf, lemon, and mint,&rdquo; she piped. She gestured at the\n      displayed sample. &ldquo;And, obviously, sky.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot suppressed an eye-roll. Maisor Misha would call a black belt a\n      &ldquo;charcoal cincture&rdquo;. Lunacy.{\" \"}\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Do you want to try it on?&rdquo; asked the clerk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d\n      suite you quite well if I&rsquo;m being honest.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <em>Being honest? Really?</em> mused Apricot.{\" \"}\n      <em>\n        I wonder how many clients have been told the converse.\n        <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n      </em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He jiggled his hand. &ldquo;No thank you, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;m just\n      shopping for a friend.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;A special type of friend?&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Valid assumption, honestly. Buying a Maisor Misha scarf for someone was\n      the equivalent of professing &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; in silk.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Hopeless romantic here.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Aw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;In fact, I was curious if you could write down this scarf&rsquo;s\n      serial number.&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said the clerk, blinking. &ldquo;May I ask what\n      for?&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take her to the main location in Helsea. Get her\n      opinion on it in person, you know?&rdquo; he said with a wink.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The clerk gave him a tight nod and sauntered back. He understood her\n      frustration.&nbsp;Gants Brae was a place of little wealth. A sale\n      would&rsquo;ve contributed towards a fair percentage of her monthly\n      commission. Perhaps all of it.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Any updates?</em>&rdquo; transmitted Apricot.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;\n      <em>No, but I&rsquo;ve exhausted a third of possibilities so far</em>\n      .&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Copy</em>.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot watched the woman like a son&rsquo;s mother. The clerk opened a\n      locked drawer to peruse a stack of bound together notes. She extracted a\n      blank sheet, but in the process, she briefly flashed a set of numbers.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Perfect. Maisor Misha wouldn&rsquo;t trust their own employees with their\n      wealth. Not a single worker, at least. Rather, one knew the combination to\n      the three disc by heart. Another held the physical key. But the eighteener\n      was the most secure, and tangentially, the most forgettable. Apricot\n      hypothesized that whoever safeguarded the combination had it written down.\n      Hypothesized? Sorry, more like prophesied. Now, he just needed a closer\n      peek.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; said the gorgeous clerk.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Yes, gorgeous. He predicted this would happen, hadn&rsquo;t he? The longer\n      this heist lasted, the more infatuated he would become. Too bad, by\n      tomorrow&rsquo;s daybreak, he would have lost the lady her job, and,\n      worse, broken her heart.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;\n      <em>Broke the three disc. I&rsquo;m working on the manual key, now</em>\n      .&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot smiled. &ldquo;<em>Incredible. I&rsquo;ve a lead. More soon</em>\n      .&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; asked the clerk, still holding out the note.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Keep it,&rdquo; said Apricot, maintaining his grin. &ldquo;On\n      second thought, she&rsquo;s already here. Let&rsquo;s purchase the scarf\n      today.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The woman blinked. There was that cute &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; again.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what we are going to do,&rdquo; said Apricot\n      elegantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy the scarf, but you keep it. Plus, the\n      commission.&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The clerk&rsquo;s jaw trembled. &ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m flattered, but\n      &hellip;&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot waved his hand dismissively.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think much of it. I&rsquo;m mesmerized by your sales\n      tactics, and nothing more.&rdquo; He winked. &ldquo;Besides, a good\n      saleswoman should wear the merchandise, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo; The clerk&rsquo;s eyes did a\n      jig, the confused, adorable kind. &ldquo;I, uh&mdash;&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to <em>do</em>. You take that serial\n      number and return it to where it came from. Next, ring me up.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The woman managed to smile and nod. She was under his trance, no doubt. To\n      be fair, he&rsquo;d cheated. Jox stalked her in advance. Five days ago,\n      her fianc&eacute;e had abandoned her. Something about pursuing a\n      woodworking business &hellip; Apricot couldn&rsquo;t care about the\n      details. What mattered was she was desperate, and desperate folks made for\n      perfect exploits.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This time, Apricot trailed her to the counter. She opened the drawer. His\n      lightning fast eyes caught the number. Beautiful. Before the clerk could\n      spin about and catch his peeping, he sashayed to the front of the corner.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Two Seven One Six Four</em>&hellip;&rdquo; Apricot transmitted\n      the code.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Marvelous. Just broke the manual key. Eighteener is next</em>\n      .&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The clerk was peering through her index of catalogued items. She found the\n      entry with a gentle gasp.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That will be eight hundred durling,&rdquo; said the clerk softly.\n      &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t have to do this.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot was a master of deception, yes. But that didn&rsquo;t mean he was\n      immune to the cringe that came with the job. He felt the pain as anyone\n      else would.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;On second thought, you are correct. I don&rsquo;t have to do this\n      for a wretch like you.&rdquo; Apricot tipped his hat. &ldquo;Good\n      day.&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He whipped around quick enough to avoid experiencing the clerk&rsquo;s\n      reaction. She might quit before getting fired, honestly. Apricot\n      couldn&rsquo;t imagine being around co-workers that&rsquo;d seen such\n      humiliation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Eighteener is cracked</em>,&rdquo; sounded Jox.<em>&nbsp;</em>\n      &ldquo;\n      <em>\n        I&rsquo;m in the vault. Everything we hoped for is here and more.\n        Awaiting your move\n      </em>\n      .&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>Apricot spun. &ldquo;On third thought,&rdquo; he said wickedly.</p>\n    <p>\n      The clerk was hiding tears. He knew what was coming. The perfect gift for\n      Jox.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;OUT! Out and never return!&rdquo; shrieked the lady. The others ran\n      to her side attempting to calm her down. &ldquo;That was so cruel.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot smirked, walked out, and heard Jox&rsquo;s confirmation\n      immediately after.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Door closed. Great work falling in and out of love</em>.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Easy for you to say</em>,&rdquo; transmitted Apricot.{\" \"}\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"p3\">\n      <br />\n    </p>\n    <p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>⁂</p>\n    <p class=\"p5\">\n      <br />\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Excellent work, Apricot.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The captain was a hefty man with a salt and pepper beard.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He stood by the\n      shop&rsquo;s entrance looking gloomy like wet stone, but he hid a smile\n      &mdash; Apricot knew it. Today, the enforcer&rsquo;d made the bust of his\n      career. Arresting Jox Li.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Jox came out screaming. &ldquo;Get off me! Get off me!&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The numbing fabrics had her wrists bound behind her back. Two enforcers\n      flanked her sides. Both hosted the elixir Pitti in their systems, and had\n      scarves levitating by their sides on standby, just in case Jox managed to\n      break free.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot smiled at her writhing figure. Jox glowered back.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>You&rsquo;re enjoying this, aren&rsquo;t you</em>,&rdquo;\n      sounded her voice.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<em>Every moment of it</em>.&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot and the captain watched Jox be haphazardly thrown into the hansom.\n      She wasn&rsquo;t given a moment of rest. The free, anesthetic scarves\n      darted towards her and bound her ankles.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see what I stopped today,&rdquo; said Apricot\n      stately. &ldquo;May I go down with you, Captain?&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The captain shrugged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly policy, but\n      sure.&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Together, they ventured into the store&rsquo;s basement. Since it was\n      Amulday, the place was supposed to be totally deserted. Instead, enforcers\n      pruned nooks and crannies, contemplating how Jox might&rsquo;ve entered\n      the vault. Good luck to them.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot had expected something sizable, but this vault was elephantine.\n      Inside, enforcers were emptying bags of durling. Jox had stuffed every\n      single coin. Impressive, even for her.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still trying to figure out how she would&rsquo;ve\n      gotten the money out,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;No chance someone\n      could lift all these coins, even with a team. But she bagged\n      everything.&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot shrugged. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Jox Li. Trust me, Captain.\n      She&rsquo;s a criminal like no other.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Without a vigilante like you, we&rsquo;d never have caught\n      her.&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Apricot scoffed. &ldquo;This time, how about you manage to keep her locked\n      up, eh?&rdquo;<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The captain grunted. &ldquo;You sure you don&rsquo;t want a job?&rdquo;\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Ah, the routine job offer. The captain never gave up on it. After all, the\n      ten percent this time was going to be a fortune. Might cost the captain\n      his own job. Who knows? Who cares?\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good where I am,&rdquo; said Apricot.\n      <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He couldn&rsquo;t hide his goofy smile. She&rsquo;d be proud.

The thing was,\n      if the intruder was a Consortium sortix, he hardly looked the part.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The man wore an ordinary trench that poorly matched his mustard pants. He\n      sported a shabby beard, a pronounced mustache, and shoddily combed hair.\n      Even his knees were a mess, capped with ashy shells that could&rsquo;ve\n      flaked off like snakeskin.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She secretly watched from the chateau&rsquo;s third story attic where she\n      was supposed to be <em>hiding</em>.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The man said something brief. The friar, the religious elder of her home,\n      responded with a nod, his legs subtly shaking. No fists raised, nor\n      eyebrows. Then, the poorly-dressed man pulled two items out of his coat:\n      glass bottles, tall and thin like tubes. Each imprisoned a lilac liquid.\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Elixirs,&rdquo; mouthed Mira. &nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      She&rsquo;d never seen an elixir before, but she&rsquo;d heard that the\n      cocktails came in various sorts of shades and sizes with all kinds of powers.\n      Friar Sorin forbade their use, something about them being dangerous. But\n      today, the friar obliged the offering, plucking a vial seemingly at\n      random. The stranger furled his fingers around the other. After a shared\n      nod, the two men, young and old, uncorked the little things and swished\n      the contents down their throats.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <em>Dear Celestine.&nbsp;</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The whites of the man&rsquo;s eyes turned yellowish like pus. In a\n      wingbeat, the color cleared, but the eyelids kept apart like those of a\n      corpse, motionless for seconds. Five seconds. Ten. Twenty. Then, a blink.\n      The man wiped his lashes. He cracked a thin smile and shook hands with the\n      friar.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      And the friar &hellip; he patted the intruder&rsquo;s shoulders &hellip;\n      lovingly? Mira couldn&rsquo;t make sense of it. A minute ago, the two\n      resembled strangers. Enemies, even. Suddenly, they were friends?&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Now, the friar rambled. Proper rambling with body sways and finger\n      pointing. He gestured towards the forest, the courtyard, and, alas,\n      directly at the attic&rsquo;s window. The visitor glanced up.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Shoot,&rdquo; hissed Mira as she tucked her head from view.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Her heartbeat raced. Had the man seen her? Was he here to draft her?\n      &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      No, the friar would never allow that. The old man always cared for her. If\n      the stranger was here to draft young girls like herself into the\n      Consortium military, to make her a sortix to serve the awful Consort\n      &hellip; then the friar would lie and deny that Mira even existed. She was\n      sure of that. &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira faintly heard the front door creak two stories below. Peaking out the\n      window, she confirmed her fear&mdash;the field was now bare. She\n      considered going downstairs, but she couldn&rsquo;t shake the image of the\n      bewitched eyes. What type of elixir had they drunk? Why had it made the\n      friar so amicable to that man? This could be a trap. A kidnapping, even.\n      Hiding remained the best move.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira rushed to the cabinet. Opening the doors, she smelled a rancid\n      stench. Ms. Podima must&rsquo;ve never washed the sheets after\n      Dova&rsquo;s passing. Mira rolled herself to the back and pulled her\n      sister&rsquo;s old linens over her. Something about this felt\n      uncomfortable. This was Dova&rsquo;s favorite hiding spot back then, and\n      now Mira was wrapped in the same fabrics that her sister died atop.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira waited. There was nothing for minutes. Then, muffled noises\n      crescendoed<em>.&nbsp;</em>She corkscrewed her body tighter as the sounds\n      only became clearer. Someone was meters from the cabinet. Was she about to\n      be drafted by the Consortium? To serve in one of those baby-blue, hideous\n      uniforms?&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <em>Stay still</em>, she told herself.\n      <em>&nbsp;Stay still &hellip; stay still &hellip; stay&mdash;</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Mira?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      The cabinet door opened, and Mira tumbled out.{\" \"}\n      <em>Thank goodness.&nbsp;</em>It was just Friar Sorin and nobody\n      else.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He chuckled. &ldquo;Clever, but I&rsquo;ve played hide-and-seek with Dova\n      too.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira dusted off her dress. A hundred questions poked her mind, but she\n      only managed to ask one.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;What does that man want?&rdquo;</p>\n    <p>\n      The friar half-smiled and blinked his green eyes. He was about to share a\n      life lesson&mdash;Mira knew the friar&rsquo;s antics better than\n      anyone.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Do not rush to conclusions about strangers,&rdquo; said the friar.\n      His voice was soothing, as always. &ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t anyone to\n      fear. They just want to meet you.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;They?&rdquo; Mira had only seen one person&mdash;that\n      poorly-dressed man.\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; instructed the friar, moseying to the stairs.</p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Wait, who are they?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      The friar smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn soon enough.&rdquo; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Like a flame on a wick, Mira trailed the friar&rsquo;s ambling downwards.\n      He ignored the dozen-odd questions whispered to him. &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <em>Woah.&nbsp;</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The entire Golden Coterie&mdash;a ridiculous name the Golden\n      Chateau&rsquo;s residents called themselves by&mdash;was crammed into the\n      dining room, chattering loudly. In the center, the two strangers\n      stood.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The man Mira&rsquo;d spied from the attic wore an expression as tight as\n      his shoelaces. Beside him was a woman wearing rugged gloves, the type used\n      for handling reins<em>.</em> She was young, maybe in her mid-twenties, and\n      possessed auburn hair and a freckled face. She wore a hat and a jacket,\n      both in Consortium blue. She must&rsquo;ve been the carriage&rsquo;s\n      driver.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The friar grunted softly, hushing the residents. His wobbly eyes surveyed\n      the room. &ldquo;Hmm. Why&rsquo;s everyone here?&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Pozipoo, a flautist who lived three\n      doors from Mira. He scratched his dry cheeks as he talked, his bushy\n      eyebrows bouncing like rabbit feet. &ldquo;We hardly get a visitor, much\n      less two. Who are they?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Uh, we are &hellip;&rdquo; the strange man tailed off.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Monks,&rdquo; said the friar firmly. &ldquo;Monks from\n      Belathia.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The man&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, indeed! We&rsquo;re\n      monks. My name is &hellip; uh, Brother Froult.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira wasn&rsquo;t sure about that. She knew nothing about monks, but that\n      alibi was &hellip; convenient. The friar was obsessed with Belathia, a\n      small city tucked deep in the old Celestine Kingdom. The old man rambled\n      about that place without end. Did these so-called monks actually travel\n      across the Innermost to reach the lonely western cliffs, or was the friar\n      covering something up? &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; casually asked Mr. Flen, the full-time\n      chef and part-time fool of the house. He was standing cross-armed,\n      cross-legged, leaning against the wall. His lame foot rested crooked\n      against the ground. &ldquo;Most of us are already Celestines.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to talk to the girl,&rdquo; said Brother Froult\n      softly. He glanced side-to-side and added, &ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Hearing that stunned Mira. She was the only surviving girl in the house.\n      He was undoubtably talking about her.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;To Mira? No way.&rdquo; Mr. Flen stepped forward, his little\n      fingers made into tiny fists. &ldquo;Mira&rsquo;s a young girl. Whatever\n      you have to say to her, you can say it here and be on your way.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;I insist&mdash;&rdquo; started Brother Froult.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I insist you get to why you&rsquo;re here or leave this\n      instant.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira understood Mr. Flen&rsquo;s apprehension. If anyone was to be afraid\n      of strangers, it was him. His sons had been kidnapped by Consortium\n      sortixes during a raid of his old home in some town. He&rsquo;d escaped,\n      and after giving up on searching for them, he happened upon the chateau\n      and settled down.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Flen, please,&rdquo; said the friar softly. &ldquo;They mean no\n      harm.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      That hardly assuaged the man&mdash;he tightened his grimace, his pupils\n      darting left and right like frightened fish.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>The female monk returned Mira&rsquo;s gawking with a smile.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You look precious, dear. You can call me Ms. Astrid.&rdquo; The\n      woman tapped her cheek suggestively. &ldquo;Or Sister Astrid, I\n      suppose.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira narrowed her eyes threateningly, hoping the trembles running up her\n      legs weren&rsquo;t obvious. Why were they lying so &hellip; poorly?\n      Consortium sortixes couldn&rsquo;t be <em>this</em> bad at disguises.\n      &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a monk, why&rsquo;re you dressed like a\n      sortix?&rdquo; muttered Mira.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Sister Astrid laughed. &ldquo;A sortix? Oh, now that&rsquo;s a good\n      one.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;If I was a sortix, you&rsquo;d be dead by now. This is just a{\" \"}\n      <em>disguise</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Her companion grunted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wearing a Consortium garb,\n      Sister Astrid. The girl asked a fair question.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Pfft. She has no reason to be concerned. I am not some evil\n      henchman.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <em>Because you&rsquo;re a henchwoman instead</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>thought\n      Mira. Granted, to the Sister Astrid&rsquo;s consolation, she hardly fit\n      the stereotypes associated with sortixes. The brawny, gruff sort or\n      shifty, shady type were common ones. Not feverish madwoman. But if they\n      weren&rsquo;t sortixes, and they clearly weren&rsquo;t monks, who were\n      they?&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Pozipoo stood with hands on his hips, fingers tapping like he was playing\n      one of his flutes. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you even get that shiny carriage?\n      Ya&rsquo;ll seem like some real snappers to me!&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira wasn&rsquo;t sure what a <em>snapper&nbsp;</em>was, most likely a\n      word that the musician invented, but she agreed with Pozipoo&rsquo;s\n      sentiment.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;A good question,&rdquo; said Sister Astrid. &nbsp;</p>\n    <p>&ldquo;And I expect a good answer!&rdquo; said Pozipoo.</p>\n    <p>&ldquo;We stole it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      Pozipoo furrowed his thick brows. &ldquo;You, two <em>monks</em>, stole a\n      carriage?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Sister Astrid subtly smiled. &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s\n      full of surprises.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Pozipoo grunted. Mira wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was satisfied, but she\n      surely wasn&rsquo;t. She glanced up at the Friar&rsquo;s dangling beard\n      that curled like hanging moss.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Please tell me, friar,&rdquo; she requested gently. &ldquo;Why are\n      they actually here?&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The friar bit his lip, blinking vacantly. He was uncomfortable, no\n      doubt.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Please, uh, Ms.&mdash;sorry, Sister Astrid and Brother Froult. Tell\n      Mira what you&rsquo;ve brought her. Tell her about &hellip; the{\" \"}\n      <em>teapot</em>.&rdquo; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes, yes the teapot!&rdquo; said Sister Astrid, clapping all\n      giddily. &ldquo;We come here bearing a teapot blessed by &hellip; uh\n      &hellip;&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The Celestine Lord himself,&rdquo; finished off Brother\n      Froult.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Now the residents whispered approvingly. <em>Great</em>. This was just\n      typical. Apprehensive about literally anything else, but everyone was\n      suddenly so trusting the moment the Celestine Lord was mentioned. The\n      messiah lived centuries ago. Claims of anything he&rsquo;d touched or\n      blessed were worthy of pilgrimages, especially to devout Celestines like\n      Ms. Podima.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira, on the other hand, was hardly a devout Celestine. &ldquo;The\n      Celestine Lord blessed a teapot?&rdquo; she asked mockingly. &ldquo;A{\" \"}\n      <em>teapot</em>?&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;How fortuitous of you to be skeptical,&rdquo; said Sister Astrid.\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Because the teapot blesses children like yourself with good\n      luck.&rdquo; Sister Astrid glanced at her companion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d\n      love to bless you in a room.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;A private room,&rdquo; clarified Brother Froult.</p>\n    <p>\n      Mira took two steps back. So these two were strictly interested in talking\n      to her. She&rsquo;d lived in this isolated house all her life. What could\n      she have to do with monks, the Consortium, or whoever else these two were?\n      &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Absolutely not,&rdquo; said Ms. Podima staunchly. &ldquo;You can\n      bless her in front of us right here, so we can all see this teapot.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Ms. Podima hadn&rsquo;t been the nicest soul to Mira all these years. She\n      would criticize her fishing, her sweeping, and even her walking at any\n      opportunity. Mira was certain that the old woman just wanted to see this\n      teapot&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t have given two licks about Mira&rsquo;s\n      safety. &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be blessed,&rdquo; said Mira resolutely.</p>\n    <p>&ldquo;No, no, you must be blessed,&rdquo; insisted Ms. Podima.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Aunty, I <em>kindly</em> don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; bellowed the friar. &ldquo;Show her the\n      teapot, Sister Astrid.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He patted Mira&rsquo;s shoulders forcefully. Now <em>this</em> was\n      surprising. Albeit being an ordained friar, the man never forced his\n      beliefs on Mira. That was why she loved him so much. He listened. He\n      wasn&rsquo;t cruel. He cared about what she thought. Was that purple\n      elixir he drank messing with his brain? &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Sister Astrid dramatically bowed at the request, a painful sight to watch.\n      Then, out of her cloak, she unraveled the promised thing.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The teapot was clearly heavy. Decorative bumps encircled its shallow body.\n      The spout crooked upwards at an uncanny angle. There was no handle, the\n      vessel simply resting on Sister Astrid&rsquo;s flattened palm. Peculiarly,\n      the pot&rsquo;s material was black&mdash;the blackest of blacks&mdash;as\n      if it sucked in light itself.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Now t-t-that&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; stuttered Ms. Podima, her\n      eyebrows quivering. &ldquo;The Celestine Lord blessed that himself? Oh my.\n      May I touch it?&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; hissed Sister Astrid. Then, she blinked away her frown.\n      &ldquo;Sorry. It&rsquo;s for children only. For Mira.&rdquo; She pivoted\n      on a single foot to face Mira. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all yours, girl.\n      Approach.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira, hesitant, remained still. &ldquo;Why&rsquo;re you so insistent,\n      ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Why, because&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      The woman had taken two steps closer, but suddenly halted and gasped. From\n      the teapot&rsquo;s spout, a mystifying liquid flowed outwards, forwards,\n      bending through the air like a preying serpent. The liquid was red,\n      shinier than blood, glimmering like a melted ruby. Mira couldn&rsquo;t\n      take her eyes off the phenomenon, realizing that the magical stream was\n      inching towards her.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Sister Astrid jumped backwards. The liquid quickly coiled back into the\n      pot like a spooked snake.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Oh my,&rdquo; she muttered whilst glaring at her companion.\n      &ldquo;We &hellip; we should &hellip;&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; completed Brother Froult. He bowed a few times to\n      various people around the room. &ldquo;Thank you for having us. Thank you.\n      You have a good day.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said the friar, his jaw quivering. &ldquo;What\n      about&mdash;&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Later,&rdquo; said Brother Froult. &ldquo;I promise, please. Not\n      now.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The two monks pushed their way out of the house, swiftly departing. Mira\n      gently chased after them, mesmerized by the marvel she&rsquo;d just\n      witnessed. That liquid had been reaching for her! She couldn&rsquo;t shake\n      the impossible thing from her head, and judging from the crowd following\n      behind her, neither could they.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;How&rsquo;d it do that?&rdquo; Mira called out. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d\n      the teapot do that?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Without acknowledging they&rsquo;d heard her, Brother Froult and Sister\n      Astrid scrambled out of the door, hurrying back to their carriage. Brother\n      Froult jumped into the car&rsquo;s plush compartment while Sister Astrid\n      hopped into the driver&rsquo;s box, quick to whip the horses.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As the carriage rolled off, Mira locked eyes with Sister Astrid. The woman\n      whispered something to Mira, words too soft for Mira to surely comprehend\n      them, but loud enough for her to determine the gist.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll &hellip; come &hellip; you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      As curiously as they had arrived, the carriage whooshed away, cutting\n      through the towering harka grass that was taller than cornstalks and\n      racing towards the Fifty-Year Forest, the woods that people venture into\n      to die.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <br />\n    </p>\n    <p className=\"noIndent center\">⁂</p>\n    <p>\n      <br />\n    </p>\n    <p className=\"noIndent\">\n      The entire incident had left the chateau&rsquo;s gossip in shambles. Ms.\n      Podima was certain they&rsquo;d witnessed a miracle from her messiah.\n      Pozipoo called it illusionist blubbery, believing that the\n      &ldquo;monks&rdquo; were getting candid reactions to some magic trick of\n      theirs. Mr. Flen, after mumbling some unpleasant things, returned to his\n      kitchen to cook the fish Mira&rsquo;d caught earlier in the day.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Each time Mira had run into Friar Sorin during the last three hours,\n      he&rsquo;d paced off whilst muttering something unintelligible.\n      Mira&rsquo;d never seen the old man behave like this. This was the first\n      time he&rsquo;d hid something from her.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Those two were some real idiots,&rdquo; said Mr. Coogley, sitting\n      with legs on the table. &ldquo;Total loonies, traveling into the forest\n      like that.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Was weird they even found us,&rdquo; muttered Mira.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      The Golden Chateau, an odd-house comprised of randomly acquainted folks,\n      rarely got guests, mostly someone&rsquo;s estranged family visiting to\n      collect some debt. The only safe way to reach the chateau was via the\n      narrow southern pass. Traveling through the forest was a near death\n      sentence&mdash;the place was crawling with dangerous creatures.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You think they&rsquo;re hiding in the forest?&rdquo; suggested\n      Mira. &ldquo;If they stole that carriage, maybe they&rsquo;re hiding from\n      the Consortium?&rdquo; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;What do you know, child?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      Mr. Coogley was cruel to her like this, usually for no reason. He had no\n      blood family here, having found the place after running off from\n      Rothersby, fleeing some lawsuit. He&rsquo;d decided to the join the\n      residents&rsquo; incompetent ranks on a whim.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The carriage was made out of metal,&rdquo; said Mira. &ldquo;Maybe\n      that&rsquo;s enough protection from the forest&rsquo;s\n      beasties.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Your daddy stepped on a blueneck, and now you&rsquo;re a beasties\n      expert?&rdquo; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira rolled her eyes and strolled off. Mr. Coogley had no manners. Yes,\n      her father died after getting stung by a blueneck scorpion, a critter\n      whose venom rivaled the poison of fifty-thousand kisra bites. He&rsquo;d\n      ventured just a few meters into the forest when his foot was impaled. Mira\n      was just three-years old; she couldn&rsquo;t remember him at all. But\n      everyone, especially Mr. Coogley, talked about the incident like it was\n      her father&rsquo;s own fault. In actuality, bluenecks were rare. Ultra\n      rare. Her father was unlucky, nothing more.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira climbed the creaky staircase that piped notes louder than Pozipoo\n      could ever muster. She wanted to go outside to sit on the brick piles, her\n      trusted spot to watch flying kisras reveal their glowing\n      underbellies.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She entered the coatroom and opened the cabinet to retrieve her better\n      coat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <em>Pitter pitter pitter pitter pitter.</em>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      That was the sound of kisras, particularly the sound of their double\n      wings. A whole swarm&rsquo;s worth. She glanced through the window into\n      the front yard. The bugs were multiplying into the air, darting towards\n      the same target&mdash;the forest.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The throng encircled a spot near the forest&rsquo;s edge,\n      uncharacteristically&nbsp;&nbsp;avoiding the woods. <em>Weird</em>. It was\n      as if the slender eldertrees that stretched into the air were caging the\n      bugs like cell doors.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      When Mira glanced back at the cupboard to close it, she gasped. Through\n      the cabinet&rsquo;s inner mirror, she could see the front-yard. She could\n      see the forest. She could see the kisras swarming, but now, they were\n      congregating around the Consortium carriage! It was there, parked at the\n      forest&rsquo;s edge.\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Celestine almighty,&rdquo; Mira whispered to herself.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      Through the bare window, she could only see the myriad buzzing around\n      empty air. Yet, through the mirror, she could see the horde surrounding\n      the carriage. The strangers were somehow concealing themselves from naked\n      sight. Mira struggled to make sense of it. Were they using an\n      elixir?&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Friar?&rdquo; called Mira, his door meters from the coatroom.\n      &ldquo;Friar, are you&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you doing,&rdquo; asked Mr. Coogley loudly as he\n      climbed the stairs.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>Mira quickly shut the cabinet. &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Incompetent.&rdquo; Mr. Coogley strode past her, strutting down the\n      hallway. &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira opened the cabinet slowly. She wasn&rsquo;t crazy&mdash;the baby-blue\n      vehicle was parked on the wood&rsquo;s edge. What were they up to?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira crept down the stairs to discover Ms. Podima making her way into the\n      atrium on her afternoon sweep.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;re you going child?&rdquo; said the woman dryly.\n      &ldquo;Going to fish?&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Already did. I&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      Mira yanked open the front door and scurried down the steps. She\n      wasn&rsquo;t going to let those two strangers get away.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go near the forest,&rdquo; yelled Ms. Podima from\n      inside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the season for bluenecks.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira wasn&rsquo;t phased by the warning. Between her father&rsquo;s death\n      and today, she&rsquo;d encountered a single blueneck, and it was just a\n      baby.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The harka grass was terribly tall today. It towered over Mira&rsquo;s body\n      by half a meter, the blades yellowish given the autumn season. It was her\n      responsibility to scythe the lawn&mdash;alongside every other survival\n      task that the chateau demanded&mdash;and she&rsquo;d procrastinated mowing\n      the harka for over a moon. For most adults, the grass was worse than\n      poison ivy, rendering instantaneously itchy rashes, but Mira&rsquo;d\n      played in the fields so much when Dova was alive that she&rsquo;d built up\n      an immunity.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Without the mirror, she couldn&rsquo;t see the mysteriously vanishing\n      carriage, but she remembered its rough position. The chateau was\n      surrounded by the Fifty-Year Forest, the woods swooping around the\n      residence like a horseshoe. The vehicle had been parked just on the\n      wood&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As she got closer, she started to hear faint whispers. She slowed her\n      approach, careful not to crack any thicket under her little feet. The\n      harka was so plentiful that it surrounded her like water, even clogging\n      her nose a little.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>Finally, she was within earshot to make out the voices.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Seriously, monks?&rdquo; That sounded like Sister Astrid. &ldquo;Do\n      I look like a <em>Sister</em> to you? Do I look <em>bald&nbsp;</em>to\n      you?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Finally, hard proof they weren&rsquo;t monks&mdash;Mira felt satisfied\n      having figured that out from the onset.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Calm down, Astrid,&rdquo; said Brother&mdash;or better said,\n      Mr.&mdash;Froult.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;A blessed teapot is unbelievable hogwash!&rdquo;</p>\n    <p>&ldquo;That old lady believed it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Mira <em>clearly&nbsp;</em>didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not vilify our friend here,&rdquo; said Mr. Froult.\n      &ldquo;He was just trying to help cover for us.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; replied a feeble voice. &ldquo;I gave\n      you a terrible alibi, I apologize.&rdquo; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Friar Sorin was with them! No wonder Mira couldn&rsquo;t find him in the\n      house. The old man had ventured off to meet the strange visitors out here.\n      How could he after ignoring her all this time? What was he hiding? He, of\n      all people! &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;In hindsight, perhaps we should&rsquo;ve planned a better cover\n      story in case the others intervened,&rdquo; said Mr. Froult.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Or, <em>perhaps</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>we should&rsquo;ve taken the\n      girl when we had a chance.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No. Our instructions were for her to come willingly, no exceptions.\n      It was better for us to leave to regroup.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;What possibly for?&rdquo;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;To figure out <em>how&nbsp;</em>to tell her. How to talk to\n      her.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira prayed they couldn&rsquo;t hear her breathing. What was Mr. Froult\n      talking about? To tell her what, exactly? Had something happened?&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go there right now and swoop her up?&rdquo;</p>\n    <p>\n      Mr. Froult scoffed. &ldquo;You mad, Astrid? We arrived in a Consortium\n      carriage.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;We told her the truth. It&rsquo;s a disguise!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know that! She wouldn&rsquo;t trust us. She{\" \"}\n      <em>shouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;</em>trust us.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>&ldquo;What do you suggest, then?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>\n      Mr. Froult&rsquo;s voice softened. &ldquo;We were giving an explanation to\n      why she&rsquo;d come. Here, friar, could you make sense of this&mdash;hold\n      on, I need to reveal it.&rdquo;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There was a short pause filled with Mira&rsquo;s thumping heartbeats. She\n      couldn&rsquo;t make sense of any of this. Who were they if they\n      weren&rsquo;t monks nor the Consortium? Why did friar trust them? What was\n      Mr. Froult showing him?&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo; continued Mr. Froult. &ldquo;What do you make\n      of this?&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There was a short pause. Then, the Friar feebly whispered, &ldquo;Oh dear.\n      This is referring to Dova&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Hearing Dova&rsquo;s name sent Mira backtracking so quickly that she\n      tripped over something, falling backwards into the harka, and yelped. But\n      she couldn&rsquo;t care about her blunder. Dova&rsquo;s death? That day,\n      that awful memory, had plagued Mira&rsquo;s mind. What had these two to do\n      with Dova&rsquo;s sudden illness?&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Ms. Astrid. &ldquo;I swear,\n      someone&rsquo;s out there.&rdquo; &nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mira wanted to reveal herself and interrogate them. She couldn&rsquo;t.\n      She was paralyzed by fear, not of the strangers or the overhead matters,\n      but by something much worse.&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A blueneck scorpion, a massive one with awfully swollen limbs, had crawled\n      onto her chest.
